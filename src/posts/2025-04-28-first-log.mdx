# Confronting the Crisis of Our Generation

Imagine you're the prime minister of Poland, foreseeing an impending tsunami poised to wipe out half your nation's population, devastate your economy, and leave infrastructure in ruins. Wouldn't you take every possible action to prevent it?

Similarly, if Hitler invaded Poland today, obliterating half the population, destroying the economy, and burning every crop in his path, wouldn't defending your nation become your immediate duty?

The logic is identical: Whether a catastrophe is natural or human-made, a true leader, driven by heroism or responsibility, must act decisively to protect their people’s happiness and well-being.

## The Modern Tsunami: Isolation

Our generation faces its own crisis—the rise of social media and gaming. These platforms are so engaging that they virtually eliminate boredom, providing instant dopamine hits far easier than the effort required to form genuine connections with neighbors and friends. Worse yet, negative, cynical, and inflammatory content often garners far more attention online, creating a culture of skepticism and hesitance about building new relationships.

These phenomena drive a troubling reality today—a declining sense of genuine human connection and diminishing willingness to collaborate. Without meaningful face-to-face friendships, people increasingly chase tangible but hollow goals, such as wealth. Societal pressures amplify this mindset:

- "If I don’t have enough money, my child won't have a good life."
- "I must become a billionaire, or I'm failing."
- "If I don’t earn a lot, I'm wasting my life."

Such beliefs overshadow the profound fulfillment found in everyday roles. Waitresses find joy in customers' smiles; factory workers discover creativity in routine tasks. Yet, subconscious comparisons—"someone else has nicer things"—make us overlook the happiness already within our grasp.

## A Vicious Cycle of Isolation

Here's the crux: When people undervalue genuine human connections and meaningful interactions, they naturally hesitate to form families or have children, fueling a societal crisis. A declining population leads to:

- Reduced workforce and smaller social security systems
- Decreased governmental funds
- Reduced consumer spending, leading to abandoned factories and monopolies crushing small businesses
- Increased loneliness, fewer children, and even greater isolation

This self-perpetuating cycle is severe and measurable:

- **Cigna U.S. Loneliness Index (2018)**: Generation Z (ages 18–22) reported the highest loneliness scores among over 20,000 surveyed adults.
- **University of Tokyo Analysis (2019)**: Nearly 25% of Japanese individuals under 39 remain virgins, highlighting severe social isolation.

Globally, mental hospital admissions are rising, while overall quality of life declines.

## A Solution: Rebuilding Connections

The root issue is clear: people deeply desire meaningful friendships but often need encouragement. They need reminders that connecting with others is rewarding, that many share their hopes, struggles, and dreams. People need reassurance they're not alone and that their genuine voices matter far beyond superficial social media portrayals.

Many lonely individuals struggle with social skills. I’ve experienced firsthand how heartfelt letters can overwhelm recipients because, like many, I'm deeply emotional yet struggle to express myself openly. Men especially face challenges in expressing vulnerability due to societal pressures. Despite my passion for science and problem-solving, sharing these interests can be difficult. Online negativity amplified by algorithms makes interactions daunting. Embarrassment or busy lifestyles often prevent meaningful engagements, further deteriorating social skills and mental health.

### My Solution: A Conversational Chatbot

I propose creating a chatbot specifically designed to improve social skills through conversation. As users become more comfortable and confident, the bot gradually matches them with others sharing similar interests and values, facilitating genuine human interactions and rebuilding meaningful connections.

Ultimately, my ambition is to collaborate with governments committed to societal well-being, launching widespread initiatives—perhaps humorously called "Match Your Wife"—to comprehensively tackle loneliness.

Together, we can restore genuine connections and enhance global well-being.

Thank you for joining this crucial journey.
